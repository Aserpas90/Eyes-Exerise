## DESCRIPTION

Another simple, yet slightly more complex showcase of some basic languages learned so far. The eye (designed with CSS) will be centered in the page and will follow your mouse around (JavaScript and HTML)


## HOW TO RUN

Clone this repository, then open the index.html link!

## ROADMAP

Add more functionality to go along with the eye movement.
